## Hello :yellow_heart: :sparkles:

My name is Linn and I am a Frontend Developer (soon, at least). 

I am from Stavanger in Norway, but I live in the rainy city of Bergen :umbrella:


I love cats :cat:, coding, creating stuff, great design (in all shapes and forms), hiking, traveling, fashion and interior design.
